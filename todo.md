# To Do

1. Add formatting of `scope` content to ensure consistent formatting. If no spaces between words values, add one after the comma.
1. Is the `scope` field ever in a snippets file in an extension?
1. Refactor `language` field in *snippet-collection.js*. It only applies to user snippets if I remember correctly.
1. This snippet extension - https://open-vsx.org/extension/hollowtree/vue-snippets - appears to cause an error.
1. Refactor Extensions make more comprehensible. Particularly code around extension-related snippets and the view.
1. Show the shortcuts assigned to any snippets (via command 'insert snippet')?
