# To Do

## Changes to consider

1. Support multi-root workspaces. For multi-root workspaces, a sub workspace can have its own snippets in its .vscode folder. You would need to look at the `.code-workspace` to discover the sub workspaces.
1. This snippet extension - https://open-vsx.org/extension/hollowtree/vue-snippets - appears to cause an error.
1. Show the shortcuts assigned to any snippets (via command 'insert snippet')?
