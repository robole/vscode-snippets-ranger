You can view the source snippet file. This makes it simple to edit your user snippets.

## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `Snippets Ranger: Show me that dur Range, Partner`.

## Features Under Consideration

1. Add "create new snippet" command which enables quickly adding a new snippet. It copies the selected text, opens the snippet file for that language, inserts a snippet using the text on the clipboard as the *body*, and allows editing of the other fields.
1. Filter out languages that have only 'Region Start' and 'Region End' snippets.
1. Show the shortcuts assigned to any snippets (via command 'insert snippet').

## Installation

1. Inside VS Code: Type `Ctrl+P`, write `ext install robole.snippets-ranger` in the text field, and hit `Enter`.
1. From the Command-line: Run the command `code --install-extension robole.snippets-ranger`.
1. From the [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robole.snippets-ranger): Click the _Install_ button.
