Snippets are shown in an **easy to read [webview](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview)**.

Snippets are formed into posses:
- ***Project***: These are the snippets contained in the `.vscode` folder of the current workspace,
- ***User***: These are the global snippet files (`.code-snippets` files) and language snippet files (`.json` files) that you created as an user on your system,
- ***Extension***: These are the snippets files that are included in extensions you have installed,
- ***App***: These are the snippets files that are packaged with VS Code.

The extension uses the exact same source files as VS Code does. No double-crossing rattlesnakes! üêç

## Easy navigation

There are **sticky headings** to ensure you can browse through long snippet lists without losing context. ü¶éüîù

![Demonstration of scrolling through the user snippets section. There are 3 sticky sections: the h2 heading (user snippets), a section with a, h3 heading (markdown.json) and view source button, and the table header.W](img/screenshots/sticky-headers.webp)

The **table of contents** facilitates quick navigation to a snippets set.

<p align="center">
	<img src="img/screenshots/toc.webp" alt="Screenshot of the table of contents for the view. It has the project, user, extension, and snippet files as entries organised into these groups.">
</p>

Pressing the <kbd>Home</kbd> key will return you to the table of contents.

## Easy editing

You can **open the snippets file with the *View Source File* button** contained in the sticky header for every snippets file in the webview.

In the table, you can **edit each individual snippet with the buttons in the *Action* column**:
- The *Edit* action button (identified by the pen icon) will take you to the specific snippet in the source file to perform an edit.
- The *Delete* action button (identified by the trash icon) will delete the snippet straight away without opening the file.

If you are working in code and would like to **quickly add a snippet to a snippets file, you can use the `Snippets Ranger: Add new snippet to snippets file...` command**. It has 3 easy steps:
1. Select some code (no selection is fine too) and run the command,
1. Choose an existing snippets file or create a new file from the menu,
1. The file will be opened with a new snippet. Your selection will be in the `body` field as an array of values. You can tab through the properties to fill each one out.

## Commands

The following commands are available:

1. **`Snippets Ranger: Show me that dur Range, Partner`**: Opens the view that lists all your snippets.
1. **`Snippets Ranger: Add new snippet to snippets file...`**: Quickly add a new snippet to a snippet file of your choosing. If you have code selected, this selection will be added to the `body` of the snippet. Any dollar signs in the selection will be escaped (preceded by 2 backslashes) to prevent them being interpeted as tab stops.

## Activation

The extension is only loaded when one of the commands are executed.

## Performance

To gather and render approx 6000 snippets sourced from 18 different files, it takes 4.5 seconds on a modestly-specced laptop running Ubuntu 18. üöÄ
