**Snippets are grouped as: user, extension, and built-in snippets.** The table of contents facilitates quick navigation to a snippets set.

There are sticky headings to ensure you can browse through long snippet lists without losing context. ü¶éüîù 

The snippets body is **prettily formatted**. üåª‚ú®
