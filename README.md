**Snippets are grouped as: *User*, *Extension*, and *VS Code*.**

The table of contents facilitates quick navigation to a snippets set. Pressing the <kbd>Home</kbd> key will return you to the table of contents.

There are sticky headings to ensure you can browse through long snippet lists without losing context. ü¶éüîù

You can go to the source snippet file directly with the *View Source File* button. The extension uses **the exact same source files as VS Code**.

The *Edit* action button will take you to the specific snippet in the source file to perform an edit. The *Delete* action button will delete the snippet straight away.

The extension is only loaded when one of the commands are executed.
