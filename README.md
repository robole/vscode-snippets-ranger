## Commands

The following commands can be run from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

1. `Snippets Ranger: Show me that dur Range, Partner`: Opens the view that lists all snippets.
1. `Snippets Ranger: Add new snippet`: Quickly add a new snippet to a snippet file of your choosing. It will copy selected text to the `body` property of the snippet. If there is no text selection, it will create an empty `body`. You can tab through the properties and fill them out as a snippet (how meta!).

To gather and render approx 6000 snippets sourced from 18 different files, it takes 4.5 seconds on a modestly-specced 4-year old laptop running Ubuntu 18.
