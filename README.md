**Snippets are grouped as: *User*, *Extension*, and *VS Code*.**

The table of contents facilitates quick navigation to a snippets set. Pressing the <kbd>Home</kbd> key will return you to the table of contents.

There are sticky headings to ensure you can browse through long snippet lists without losing context. 🦎🔝

The snippet `body` is **prettily formatted**. 🌻✨
